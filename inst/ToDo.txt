analogue To Do List

   * bootstrap - apparent statistics are transposed relative
     to the bootstrap statistics (matrices only). Would be
     better to have them all the correct way round. Will
     need to fix code in print and print.summary methods for 
     bootstrap if I transpose these things, and check mat()
     and residuals.mat.
     
   * Fix-up plot.cma as it currently isn't making intelligent
     use of the plot space.
     
   * Check plot.mat as there seems to be a lot of space 
     between plots.
